# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# User.create(first_name: "Bobby", last_name: "BuffaloBoy", email: "buffaloboy55@gmail.com", password: "Wawawewa3075", phone_number: "(347)827-8072", admin: true )
